# 8. Exception Handling

---

## What is Exception Handling?

Exception handling in Java is a robust mechanism for dealing with runtime errors, ensuring the normal flow of the program is maintained. Exceptions are objects that describe an unusual or erroneous situation.

---

## Key Terms

- **Exception:** An event that disrupts the normal program flow.
- **Error:** Serious issues not intended to be caught by programs (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`).
- **Checked Exception:** Must be handled or declared (e.g., `IOException`).
- **Unchecked Exception:** Subclasses of `RuntimeException`, may not be handled (e.g., `NullPointerException`).

## Exception Hierarchy

```
Object
  └── Throwable
        ├── Exception
        │     ├── IOException
        │     ├── SQLException
        │     └── RuntimeException
        │           ├── NullPointerException
        │           └── ArithmeticException
        └── Error
              └── OutOfMemoryError
```

---

## try-catch-finally

```java
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    int x = 5 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup code here.");
}
```
- **finally** block always executes (even if an exception is not thrown).

---

## Multiple catch Blocks

```java
try {
    // risky code
} catch (IOException e) {
    // handle IO exceptions
} catch (Exception e) {
    // handle all other exceptions
}
```

---

## The throw and throws Keywords

- **throw:** Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- **throws:** Declares that a method may throw exceptions.

```java
void checkAge(int age) throws Exception {
    if (age < 18) throw new Exception("Underage");
}
```

---

## Custom Exceptions

Create your own exception by extending `Exception` or `RuntimeException`.

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
    public MyException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- Catch the most specific exceptions first.
- Never catch `Throwable` or `Exception` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use `finally` for resource cleanup (or use try-with-resources for AutoCloseable).
- Avoid empty catch blocks.
- Propagate exceptions when appropriate.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Swallowing exceptions without logging.
- Not closing resources (files, streams).
- Catching generic exceptions instead of specific ones.
- Forgetting to handle checked exceptions (compiler error).

---

## Interview Tips

- Know the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
- Be able to write custom exceptions.
- Understand try-with-resources for automatic resource management.
- Explain exception propagation.

## Possible Follow-Up Questions

- What happens if an exception is not caught?
- What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?
- Can you catch multiple exceptions in one catch block (Java 7+)?
- How do you handle resources in exception handling?
