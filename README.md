3. **[Control Flow Statements](03_Java_Control_Flow_Statements.md)**  
   Mastering `if`, `switch`, loops, and decision-making constructs.

4. **[Classes, Objects & OOP Basics](04_Java_Classes_Objects_OOP_Basics.md)**  
   The heart of Java—object-oriented principles, classes, and objects.

5. **[Inheritance & Polymorphism](05_Java_Inheritance_Polymorphism.md)**  
   Extending classes, method overriding, and runtime polymorphism.

6. **[Encapsulation, Abstraction & Access Modifiers](06_Java_Encapsulation_Abstraction_Access_Modifiers.md)**  
   Designing robust, maintainable code with encapsulation and abstraction.

7. **[Abstract Classes & Interfaces](07_Java_Abstract_Classes_Interfaces.md)**
